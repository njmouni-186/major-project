6,every one can tell depth of course but some one only give notes
11,we are getting maximum knowledge 
11,Knowledge is maximum gained  by reading books and also teachers explain the concept in depth.
9,Its fine but it should focus more towards practical knowledge rather than content based. It would be helpful for us.
7,HAVE TO IMPROVE
11,examination pattern is good
13,Good
13,"Exam pattern is up to the mark and the Cgpa depends on the various marks distributions like ca, mte etc which is very nice as compare to other institutions. Paper checking does not depend on length of ques but on the material which is the best part of it."
5,Again the university tests students of their ability to memorize stuff. Questions should emphasize more on concepts rather than testing brain's cramming storage house.
11,examination pattern is good

5,not much good 
6,exams conducting is very good .but paper correction is very bad
6,The examination pattern is good. More of logic based and subjective questions to be asked which is based upon conceptual learning. Paper checking must be done in a more lucid manner because many doubts arise with the checking of OMR sheet.
11,all these are good

5,"The evaluation is again bad for our CA, as one of our faculty is really weird. He gives us remarks on the basis of how we present things in front of it, he never look for the content of our answer, which is really annoying. As he expects us to deliver answer in the way he wants us to do. But how can a person do that, as people do have different mentality and they do explain themselves in different manner, so a teacher must understand that quality of a child and should give him marks on the basis of what they say not what they should say."
